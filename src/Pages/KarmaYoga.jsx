                Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action, teaching that one can
                attain spiritual growth and inner peace by performing one’s
                duties with the right attitude.

              Rooted in the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, Karma Yoga
              emphasizes that actions are unavoidable, but the way we perform
              them determines whether they bind us or liberate us. The central
              idea is to act without attachment to the results, a principle
              known as Nishkama Karma.
            </p>

          <section className="karmayogaContent2">
            <p>
              Instead of working for personal gain, recognition, or reward, a
              Karma Yogi performs duties sincerely and dedicates the outcomes to
              a higher purpose, such as God or the welfare of others. This
              approach reduces ego, selfishness, and anxiety, as the individual
              focuses only on effort, not on success or failure.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="karmayogaContent3">
            <p>
              Karma Yoga also classifies actions into types such as Nitya (daily
              duties), Naimittika (occasional duties), and Kamya (desire-driven
              actions), guiding individuals to gradually move toward selfless
              action. By practicing discipline, responsibility, and detachment,
              a person purifies the mind and develops qualities like humility,
              compassion, and balance.

          <section className="karmayogaContent4">
            <p>
              Ultimately, Karma Yoga is not about renouncing work but about
              transforming everyday actions into a form of spiritual practice,
              leading to inner freedom and realization of the true Self.
