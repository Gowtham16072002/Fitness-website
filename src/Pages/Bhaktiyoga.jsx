                    <br /><section className='BhaktiyogaContent1'>
                        <p>Rooted in the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, it teaches that the ultimate goal of life can be attained through pure and selfless devotion rather than only knowledge or action.</p>

                        <p>A devotee, or bhakta, expresses this love through prayer, chanting, worship, service, and constant remembrance of God. The essence of Bhakti Yoga lies in surrendering the ego and offering all thoughts, actions, and emotions to the Divine, seeing God as a beloved friend, parent, or guide.</p>

                    <section className='BhaktiyogaContent3'>
                        <p>This path is open to all, regardless of background, and emphasizes qualities like humility, compassion, trust, and unwavering faith. The Bhagavata Purana describes various forms of devotion, encouraging a continuous connection with the Divine in everyday life.</p>

                        <p>Bhakti Yoga also recognizes different types of devotees, from those who seek help in distress to those who worship with pure love and wisdom. Over time, sincere devotion purifies the heart, brings peace and joy, and ultimately leads to union with the Divine.</p>
