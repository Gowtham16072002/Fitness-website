                    <p><span><b>Strength training is a form of physical exercise designed to improve muscle strength, endurance, and overall fitness by working muscles against resistance such as weights, machines, or body weight. It plays an important role in maintaining a healthy body and preventing injuries.</b></span></p>

                        {/* <h2>Treadmill</h2> */}
                        <p>Isometric training involves muscle contraction without any visible movement. For example, holding a Plank helps build stability and core strength. Isotonic training is the most common type, where muscles change length during movement. This includes both concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) actions, as seen in exercises like Squat and Bench press.</p>

                        <p>Isokinetic training uses specialized machines that keep movement at a constant speed. It is mainly used in physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs to safely strengthen muscles. Plyometric training focuses on explosive movements that increase power and speed. Exercises like Box jump and jump squats are common examples.</p>
